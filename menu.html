                <p>This is designed to help those of you with the inability to choose a character to main. Simply follow the instructions to the side of each row to determine which characters belong where. Drag and drop the ones you want to select into place, with the knowledge that the further a character is to the left in a row means the higher it is ranked in that category. Once you're done, simply press the button beneath the characters to determine which characters you should play.
